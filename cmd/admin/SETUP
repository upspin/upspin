This document describes how to set up an Upspin cluster on the Google Cloud Platform.

- Create a Google Cloud Project: https://cloud.google.com/iam-admin/projects
  - Make sure it has an associated Billing Account.

- Enable the relevant APIs:
  - Compute: https://cloud.google.com/apis/api/compute_component/overview
  - Container: https://cloud.google.com/apis/api/container/overview
  - Container Builder: https://cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudbuild.googleapis.com/overview

- Install the Google Cloud SDK: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/

- Configure your the SDK tools to use your project:

    $ gcloud config set project $PROJECT
    $ gcloud auth login

- Create Cloud Storage buckets: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser

    $PROJECT-directory
    $PROJECT-letsencrypt
    $PROJECT-store
    $PROJECT-user

- Create service account for accessing letsencrypt bucket.
  - Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/permissions/serviceaccounts
  - Click 'Create service account'.
  - Give it a name (eg "$PROJECT-letsencrypt").
  - Check 'Furnish a new private key' (and leave 'Key type' as 'JSON').
  - Click 'Create'.
  - Put the downloaded private key somewhere safe and note its ID.

- Configure the letsencrypt bucket to be owned by that service account.
  - Visit https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser
  - Click the icon to the right of the letsencrypt bucket, and click 'Edit bucket permissions'.
  - Click 'Add item' and add a 'User' with the Service Account ID and 'Owner' permissions.
  - Click 'Save'.

- Create signed URLs for accessing letsencrypt credentials for each service,
  where SERVICE is each of frontend, userserver, dirserver, storeserver.

    $ gsutil signurl -m PUT -d 3650d <path-to-jsonkey> gs://$PROJECT-letsencrypt/$SERVICE.cache
    $ gsutil signurl -m GET -d 3650d <path-to-jsonkey> gs://$PROJECT-letsencrypt/$SERVICE.cache

  and store them in the global compute metadata,
  
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/metadata

  under these keys:

    letscloud-put-url-$SERVICE
    letscloud-get-url-$SERVICE

- Create a service account for accessing the directory and store buckets.
  - Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/permissions/serviceaccounts
  - Click 'Create service account'.
  - Give it a name (eg "$PROJECT-admin").
  - Check 'Furnish a new private key' (and leave 'Key type' as 'JSON').
  - Click 'Create'.
  - Put the JSON key file in $HOME/upspin/deploy/$PROJECT/serviceaccountkey.json

- Obtain and place the directory public and private keys in 
    $HOME/upspin/deploy/$PROJECT/dirserver/
  as public.upspinkey and secret.upspinkey.

    TODO(adg): location of these keys? or create new ones?

- Put an rc.dirserver in $HOME/upspin/deploy/$PROJECT/dirserver/

    TODO(adg): this should relate to key generation in the previous step
    TODO(adg): mention user= line once issue #1 is fixed

- Create a Google Container Engine Cluster:

    $ gcloud container clusters create <cluster-name>

- Create static IP addresses for the services:

    $ gcloud compute addresses create dirserver
    $ gcloud compute addresses create frontend
    $ gcloud compute addresses create storeserver
    $ gcloud compute addresses create userserver

  and put them in files in $HOME/upspin/deploy/$PROJECT/ip
  named the same as the address name (and the service), eg:

    $ echo a.b.c.d > $HOME/upspin/deploy/$PROJECT/ip/dirserver

- Deploy the servers to the cluster:

    $ ./deploy-servers.sh

TODO:
 generalize IP addresses
