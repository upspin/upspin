When did you last...

- download a file just to upload to another device?
- download a file from one web service just to upload to another?
- make a file public just to share it with one person?
- accidentally make something visible to the wrong people?

Upspin is an attempt to address problems like these, and many more.

Upspin is in its early days, but the plan is for you to manage all your
data—even data you've stored in commercial web services—in a safe, secure,
and sharable way that makes it easy to discover what you've got and who you've
shared it with.

If you'd like to help us make that vision a reality, we'd love to have you try
out Upspin.

Upspin is an open-source project <link> that consists of two main design
elements:

1. a set of protocols enabling secure, federated sharing using a global naming
   system; and
2. reference implementations of tools and services that demonstrate the
   capabilities.

Using these elements as a building block, Upspin provides a global name space
for all your data and the power to expand that space to include services such
as sensors, social media, and more.

To get started, [**download the Upspin client**](/dl/) and let it guide you through
the signup process. Once you've done that, you'll be able to store your data in
Upspin, share it with other Upspin users, and bring the power of the ideas of
Upspin to new information services you create.
